                <h3>Run the Messier Marathon</h3>

                    <p>It's time for the **annual Messier Marathon!** Instead of facing up there, NASA-trained astronomers will be hauling **telescopes, star charts, and a big pot of coffee** for all-night vigil hunting the Messier objects.</p>
                    <p>**Messier objects** are stellar objects, classified by astronomer **Charles Messier** in the 18th century, ranging from distant galaxies to star clusters to stellar clouds. March is the only month of the year in which all 110 Messier objects are in the sky. Unfortunately, if you want to see all of them, you have to start looking right after sunset and continue until just before sunrise — hence the term, "marathon."</p>
                    <p>Ironically, Charles Messier wasn't all that interested in his objects. He made the list in order to **avoid seeing them**. Messier was most interested in discovering new comets and these beautiful stellar objects were often mistaken for comets before Messier made his list.</p>
